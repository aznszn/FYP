00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.600
I wanna take you somewhere so
you know I care

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.600
But it's so cold and I don't know where

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.900
I brought you daffodils in a
pretty string

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.900
But they won't flower like
they did last spring

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.100
And I wanna kiss you, make you
feel alright

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.100
I'm just so tired to share my nights

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.000
I wanna cry and I wanna love

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:02.200
But all my tears have been used up

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.600
On another love, another love

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.500
All my tears have been used up

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.600
On another love, another love

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.600
All my tears have been used up

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.900
On another love, another love

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.100
All my tears have been used up

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.700
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.400
But my hands been broken, one
too many times

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.500
So I'll use my voice, I'll be
so fucking rude

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.300
Words they always win, but I
know I'll lose

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.400
And I'd sing a song, that'd be just ours

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.100
But I sang 'em all to another heart

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.100
And I wanna cry I wanna learn to love

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.600
But all my tears have been used up

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.100
On another love, another love

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.000
All my tears have been used up

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.000
On another love, another love

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.000
All my tears have been used up

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.800
On another love, another love

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
All my tears have been used up

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.500
I wanna sing a song, that'd be just ours

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.400
But I sang 'em all to another heart

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.100
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.300
But all my tears have been used up

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.200
On another love, another love

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.200
All my tears have been used up

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.100
On another love, another love

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.900
All my tears have been used up

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.800
On another love, another love

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
All my tears have been used up

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000
